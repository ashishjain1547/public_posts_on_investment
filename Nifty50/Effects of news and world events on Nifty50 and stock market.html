<pre><b>Day: 10th Aug 2017</b>
Sensex tanks 267 points. Nifty hits one-month low.

1. Market outlook: Signals bearish; key Nifty support at 9880, 9820. [1]
2. Nifty likely to drift lower, crucial support at 9862: 4 stocks to trade today: Gaba [2]

Here are 5 factors that spooked investors: 

==> 1. Weak global markets: <b>Markets from Japan to the UK were in the red on Thursday amid geopolitical concerns over North Korea’s nuke threat</b>. Investors flocked to gold that hit a two-month high and other safe havens, such as Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Hang Seng was the worst hit in Asian markets, having ended the session 1.34 per cent lower. In Europe, UK’s FTSE100 was worst hit with a 1.10 per cent fall. Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.6 per cent to 3,448.

==> 2. Poor advance-decline ratio: The advance-decline ratio was 1:9 on Thursday, even though the broader market indices recovered about 1 per cent from day’s low. A weak advance-decline ratio signals that the euphoria is over. For some time, it was being observed that even as the benchmark Sensex and Nifty were scaling new heights, the broader market that includes midcap and smallcap stocks were not participating in the rally amid concerns over valuations. Of the 2,683 companies that traded on Thursday, only 390 ended higher, suggesting a broader selloff. As selling extended to the fourth session in a row, the euphoria got over and the bulls were on the back foot.

==> 3. Valuation concern: Time and again, analysts have warned of rich valuations in the market. Selling can come into a richly valued market for any reason, as investors tend to find excuse to book profits, when they do not expect their stock to sustain at prevailing valuations. The Sensex is trading at price-to-earnings ratio of 24 compared with a five-year average PE of 19.23 and 10-year PE average of 19.33. "A 500-point froth that we were seeing on the Nifty50 is geting corrected." Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corp Affairs at India Infoline

==> 4. Sebi order: <b>Sentiment has been weak in the cash market ever since Sebi barred 331 stocks from trading, suspecting most of the firms being 'shell'</b>. There has been repors suggesting that the ban has triggered an estimated margin shortfall of around Rs 800-1,000 crore. “When the fall has to happen, you have to find a reason for it. The ongoing fall need not be attributable to Sebi ruling, but that is as good a reason, as any,” said Anand Tandon, Independent Analyst.

==> 5. Slowdown in FPI inflows: Inflows from foreign portfolio investors into India have slowed of late as rich valuations and delay in corporate earnings recovery have reduced their appetite for domestic stocks. After pouring over Rs 50,000 crore in equity markets during February-July, foreign portfolio investors have sold shares worth Rs 2,549 crore (net) in August so far, according to data available with depository NSDL.

<b>Day: 11th Aug 2017</b>

Nifty, Sensex lose over 1% to close one month lower, SBI tanks 5% on poor Q1 results
BSE Sensex closed lower by 318 points, or 1.01%, to 31,214, while the Nifty 50 fell 109 points, or 1.11%, to 9,711. 

The BSE Sensex lost over 1% to close at 31,214 points on Friday for its first weekly loss in six, <b>tracking global markets as escalating tensions between the US and North Korea continued to drive investors away from risk assets</b>.

Asian equity markets slid further and Wall Street closed sharply lower after US President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang against attacking Guam or US allies. “The mood got aggravated because global markets opened negatively... it’s more of a fear factor...,” said Anita Gandhi, whole-time director, Arihant Capital Markets, adding that markets were overripe in terms of valuation.

The broader NSE Nifty also closed down, falling 1.11% to close at 9,710.80. The benchmark BSE Sensex was 0.69% lower at 31,313.59. Both indexes are set to post nearly three percent fall on week. Nifty Bank index dropped as much as 1.3%. The index was down nearly 2.5% this week up to Thursday’s close.

Nifty Auto index fell as much 2.3% to its lowest since 24 May, with Tata Motors and Eicher Motors figuring among top losers. <b>Union Bank of India Ltd fell as much as 7.7% to its lowest in over seven months after the state-run bank’s profit fell about 30 percent, missing analysts’ estimate</b>. Shares of J Kumar Infraprojects and Prakash Industries resumed trade after India’s Securities Appellate Tribunal stayed a Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) order on trading curbs. Shares in both companies shed as much as 20%."

""The GST rate of 28 per cent is high for the leasing industry when compared to the earlier five to 15 per cent tax burden. Higher GST rates lead to requirement of higher working capital at any point of time. This results in increasing the cost of leasing an equipment,"" Finance Industry Development Council director general Mahesh Thakkar told PTI.
""The government should actively consider not bracketing the capital goods in the same GST bracket as luxury goods and sin goods. A lower GST rate will help increasing share of leasing in gross capital formation,"" he said. (From PTI)

The company recently launched 10 more screens in Pune as part of its expansion plans, taking its screen count in Maharashtra to 160 screens across 38 properties. After Pune, cities such as Mysore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Ghaziabad will see the launch of around two to three screens each in the next few months.
In all, the company currently has nearly 600 screens in India and adds about 70-75 screens every year, Chief Executive Officer Gautam Dutta told Moneycontrol. The capital expenditure for each new screen is around Rs 2.5 crore on average.
Cinema's classification in the highest GST tax slab of 28 percent, however, is being considered by industry experts to be a stumbling block. Ajay Bijli, PVR's Chairman and Managing Director, has previously said that had it not been for the high GST rate, the company would have been scaling up opportunities for the domestic box office.
Dutta said that while no negative effects of GST have been felt so far, he expects the government to take the entertainment business seriously.
