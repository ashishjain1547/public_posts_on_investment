10 Days later lets say, stock price comes down to 8 INR and you buy 10 more stocks. 
The price of stock today is 8 Rs.

<h3>Other Tips</h3>

% When markets are volatile, it is hard to detect individual good or bad stocks.

% When markets are going up, it is easier to go up with the tide but it is hard to justify why a particular low-profile stock has gone up or gone down.

% You should always compare your stock with market benchmarks such as Nifty50 and Sensex.

% Good stocks shoot up like anything when the market benchmarks are going up by like 1% (which is considered a high fluctuation for Nifty50 and Sensex).
