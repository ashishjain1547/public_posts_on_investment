The problem here is that Bitcoin's value is speculative. It increases because a few people (few with respect to the total number of people on earth) are creating the hype around it. Because of this hype and seeing that few of their friends have made money out of this, more and more people are keen on buying Bitcoins. Hence, the price keeps on increasing and you see again some of your friends getting good money. But because of this, people are now keen on buying bitcoins and storing them in the hope that price will keep on increasing. With the supply already constrained and people now storing it, it ceases to become a currency and becomes a speculative empty asset.


The idea of money exists and succeeds because there is a universal trust amongst people that it will work. This trust arises when one goes to a local store and buy his/her favorite ice-cream in exchange for a bitcoin which the shopkeeper gracefully accepts. There is no such mass based commercial application yet that can be used with Bitcoin as the currency of exchange and hence trust is difficult to build. And talking about bitcoin as a currency for local stores and daily commodities is a distant dream. Without this, all that Bitcoin is used for is just a simple form of trading between parties that are super excited and have great speculative powers.

The future of Bitcoin depends on how fast it can be accepted in people's shared imagination. Because again, like all forms of money it is only a psychological construct with zero intrinsic value.
