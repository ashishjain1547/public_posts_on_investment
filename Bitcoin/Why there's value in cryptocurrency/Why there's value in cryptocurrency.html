        Interview transcript of Ari Paul (Blocktower capital, CIO) by Sara Silverstein (Business Insider):</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Sara: Why do you fundamentally believe that there is value in this cyrptocurrency world?</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Ari: So there are quite a few use cases. I think the biggest and clearest, and easiest to understand, is as a store of value
        that can't be censored and is resistant to seizure. And so, the really clear example of demand for this, that I see,
        is the offshore banking system, which is roughly 20 trillion dollars today. And it's not just people trying to dodge
        taxes. Apple, Amazon, every billionaire on the planet has wealth stored there. And firms like JP Morgan collect fees
        to offshore law abiding citizens' wealth. And people want to store their wealth securely, in a way that no single
        judge could freeze all of their assets, right. Amazon doesn't want their entire global business operation to be shut
        down by one judge in Brussels. They want to be able to go through a lengthy appeals process and keep their business
        operating. So cryptocurrency performs same task of the offshore banking, of keeping wealth secure an order of magnitude
        better. So we see massive real fundamental demand for this use case.&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Sara: And what other financial assets make sense to be on a decentralized database or why would they?</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Ari: Yes, there's a huge distinction between the money use case, store of value, and the blockchain use case, for other assets.
        And I think it's useful to kind of separate those. So a blockchain makes a ton of sense to record in real-time legal
        title. So I was a treasury bond trader, for example, and an example in finance, that anyone who's traded treasuries
        is familier with, is: failure to deliver. So Goldman Sachs will sell a bond to Credit Suisse, who borrows it from
        JP Morgan, and the same bond in a day, might trade across 12 banks. And if one back office fails, they fail to make
        delivery of that bond, you get what's called a cascading failure to deliver. Because no one knows who actually owns
        the bond. And that can take weeks to fix. So imagine if you just have a shared database, a database that each of
        those banks held, that was kept accurate in real time and that no one could maliciously change or manipulate. You
        would know who owns what bonds and you might be able to eliminate half of the existing back offices in big banks.
        So a massive cost savings.&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Sara: So you belive in the blockchain as having a value in the future for us? How does that translate into value for cryptocurrency?&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Ari: So, yeah. I think a really useful idea - a blockchain is just a type of database. It's a distributed ledger that in
        some use cases, like for a banking back office, is kind of like a database upgrade. So massive improvements in efficiency,
        but probably not that transformative or disruptive. When you take a blockchain and you make it public and decentralized,
        and then you add money to that - you add a cryptocurrency - then you're looking at something that is that first use
        case, that offshore banking system, that I think is fundamentally disruptive. And disruptive financially, economically,
        and even potentially politically.&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Sara: Do you see any institutional money in cryptocurrency right now, and is that going to be a huge level for these values
        to skyrocket?&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Ari: Absolutely, so we've seen this really clear path of adoption. The earliest adopters were engineers, self-described cypherpunks.
        Then you had a wave of kind of Silicon Valley tech elites, people who would have a successful exit, who had a high
        risk tolerance, and who liked taking risk on new technology. Then you had kind of an early wave of maybe people like
        myself with a little more of a Wall Street background, as well as high net worth individuals, who are a little bit
        risk-tolerant. What we're seeing right now is a shift from small family offices to big. Venture capital firms are
        basically all in. So most of the famous venture capital firms, not only have they been in the space for a few years,
        they're now directly investing in new cryptocurrencies. And of the 10 largest family offices in the U.S. at least
        seven of them own cryptocurrency. Maybe more, but seven I'm sure of. So the next wave is - in kind of the institutionalization
        of the space - is we're having the CME futures that are likely to launch next month. There's a huge number of entrants
        who want to invest in cryptocurrency, but can't. For security reasons, operational reasons, regulatory, but they
        can easily buy a future, that's on the CME. So that opens the door to groups like endowmments and pensions. So far,
        endowmments and pensions own zero cryptocurrency. You have an asset that has been the highest returning assest class
        over the last eight years and it's uncorrelated to everything else. And while there's certainly debate over the future
        prospects, it lines up as the holy grail for a portfolio. In the sense that, if you size it appropriately, if you
        size it small, the risks are idiosyncratic. It actually reduces the rist of a portfolio. So endowmments and pensions,
        as they get comfortable with the space, in all aspects regulatory, compliance, as well as underwriting investment
        risk. They're going to get it. And that's a massive wall of money coming in to a relatively small asset class.&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Sara: And what do you think the timeline is for that?</div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
        Ari: I think the first endowmment is probably going to write a check in the next few months, a small check. Endowments won't
        be in size for probably six months and not in size by - from their perpective for probably 12 months. Pensions are
        probably 18 months away and the key - the reason given those dates is having thirst-party custody, that is legal
        qualified custodian, is a huge hurdle particularly for pensions. You have issue like ERISA, that are actual fiduciary
        challenges. And having a third-party qualified custodian, for many crypto assets, is probably something like 12 months
        away, maybe 18 months away.&nbsp;</div>
