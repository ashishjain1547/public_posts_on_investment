            5 Big Bitcoin Crashes</h2>
        <h2>
            1: The Meltdown of April 2013</h2>
        <br />
        <strong>What happened</strong>: In the spring of 2013, a ghastly collapse saw the price of bitcoin fall from $233 to $67—overnight!
        That’s a 71% drop. It would take seven months to recover.
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Why it happened</strong>: The crash of April 2013 came after bitcoin’s first big brush with the mainstream. The currency
        had never crossed $30 before 2013 but a flood of media coverage helped drive it well above $200. The crash, which
        followed two smaller jolts in March, reflected in part a correction to speculator exuberance. Some also attribute
        it to an outage at Mt. Gox, the most popular (at the time) exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.

        <h2>
            2: Pop Goes the 2013 Bubble</h2>
        <br />
        <strong>What happened</strong>: Bitcoin spent most of the rest of 2013 around $120. Then prices jumped ten-fold in the fall:
        Bitcoin hit a high of $1,150 in late November and then the party ended abruptly, and prices tumbled below $500 by
        mid-December. It would take more than for years for bitcoin to reach $1,000 again.

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Why it happened</strong>: The crazy price run up of late 2013 appears to have been a classic bubble as amateur investors
        rushed into bitcoin for the first time. The frenzy was helped by regulators taking a more positive view of bitcoin
        (in the early years, most regarded it as criminal—if they had heard of it at all), and by U.S. exchanges like Coinbase
        that made it easier for average people to buy bitcoin. When the bubble popped, prices would likely have recovered
        more quickly but for what happened next.

        <h2>
            3: The Mt. Gox Calamity of 2014</h2>
        <br />
        <strong>What happened</strong>: The price of bitcoin had been making big gains after the bubble pop of 2013 when, in February,
        the price fell from $867 to $439 (a 49% drop). This triggered a doldrums period for bitcoin that lasted until late
        2016.

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Why it happened</strong>: The February crash came after the operator of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox"
            rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a>—long the go-to trading place for longtime bitcoin owners—announced the exchange had been hacked. On February
        7, the exchange halted withdrawals, and later revealed thieves had made off with 850,000 bitcoins (which would be
        worth around $3.5 billion today). The incident, which created existential doubts about the security of bitcoin and
        undercut liquidity in the currency, likely harmed the currency’s value for years.

        <h2>
            4: Summer Selloff of 2017</h2>
        <br />
        <strong>What happened</strong>: Fast forward to the go-go days of 2017. In early January, bitcoin broke $1,000 for the first
        time in years and started climbing like crazy. By June, the currency nudged $3,000—but then lurched back all of a
        sudden, falling 36% to $1,869 by mid-July.

            />
        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Why it happened</strong>: Even as bitcoin boomed anew, many worried something was wrong with the code under the hood.
        Specifically, bitcoin was slow compared to other crypto-currencies like Litecoin and Ethereum, and its core developers
        couldn’t come to an agreement on how to update the software. This raised the prospect of a “fork” (which would produce
        two versions of bitcoin’s canonical blockchain) and future schisms, which in turn appeared to give rise to market
        jitters and the big fall in price. Ironically, such a fork did materialize in August in the form of rival
        <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/08/01/bitcoins-new-currency-trades-above-200-on-first-day/">Bitcoin Cash</a>—but this seems to have done no longterm harm to bitcoin.

        <h2>
            5: The Great China Chill</h2>
        <br />
        <strong>What happened</strong>: After fears over the fork subsided, bitcoin went on another crazy tear: It climbed close
        to $5,000 at the start of September before plunging 37% by September 15, shaving off over $30 billion from bitcoin’s
        total market cap in the process. A recovery is already underway, though, as prices climbed
        <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/18/bitcoin-price-china/">above $4,000</a> three days later.

        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Why it happened</strong>: While bitcoin price moves can be inscrutable, the prime reason for the latest crash can
        be summed up in one word: China. After it cracked down on so-called “Initial Coin Offerings,” there have been widespread
        rumors the Communist government is going to ban trading crypto-currency altogether. In response, the most prominent
        exchange, BTCChina, said it will end trading this month. This crackdown, combined with questions about China’s de
        facto monopoly on bitcoin mining, explains the recent price swoon.
