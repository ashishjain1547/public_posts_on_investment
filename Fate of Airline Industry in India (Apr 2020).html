<b>Case Study "Jet Airways"</b> (Ref 3)

Jet Airways (India) Ltd. is a bankrupt and grounded Indian international airline based in Mumbai, India which, on 17 April 2019, ceased all flight operations with its last revenue flight operated by a Jet Konnect Boeing 737 arriving into Mumbai on 17 April 2019. From the third quarter of 2010 onward, Jet Airways was the largest commercial passenger airline in India with a passenger market share of 22.6%. <b>With its competitors, mainly SpiceJet and IndiGo, lowering ticket fares in the following years, it was forced to follow suit, hurting overall performance resulting in steep financial losses.</b> It dropped to second place behind IndiGo in October 2017, with a passenger market share of 17.8%. The downward slide continued and resulted in bankruptcy.

<i>BANKRUPTCY AND CESSATION OF SERVICES</i>

As of November 2018, Jet Airways has been reported to have a negative financial outlook due to increasing losses. In March 2019 it was reported that nearly a fourth of Jet Airways' aircraft were grounded due to unpaid lease rates. On 25 March 2019, Mr. Naresh Goyal and his wife Anitha Goyal stepped down from the board of directors.

On 5 April, Indian Oil Corporation stopped supplying fuel to the airline, citing non-payment of dues as the emergency funds have still not been credited. On April 17, the airline suspended all flight operations, due to lenders rejecting Rs 4 billion of emergency funding and its membership in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) was suspended. <b>On 17 June, after getting no acceptable offers from Etihad Airways and Hinduja Group, lenders to Jet Airways decided to refer the company to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for bankruptcy proceedings with debt of $1.2 billion.</b>

As the group faces insolvency proceedings in Netherlands after failing to pay two debtors, NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) has allowed cross-border insolvency proceeding stating in an order that the "Dutch Trustee (Administrator) will work in cooperation with the 'Resolution Professional of India."

<b>Case Study of latest entrant in the Regional Airlines: "TruStar"</b> (Ref 5)

TruStar is an Indian low-cost airline promoted by Turbo Aviation Pvt Ltd based in Hyderabad. The airline plans to launch operations by the second quarter of 2020 with Dornier 228 aircraft.

In December 2019, Turbo Aviation announced that it had secured a Â£100-million ($133.64 million) investment from a Business Group based in the UK for the launch of commuter air services under the third place of the UDAN scheme. The airline plans to start operations with the routes they have secured under UDAN, with plans to connect passengers all over India and eventually overseas destinations in the future. The TruStar fleet will include 10 ATR-72s, 10 Airbus A320 and 4 Dornier 228 aircraft. In January 2019, under the third round of the Governments Regional Connectivity Scheme, also known as UDAN, TruStar had been awarded four routes in Uttar Pradesh, three routes across the States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Goa, two routes between Hyderabad and Prakasham Barrage of Andhra Pradesh and between Chennai and Ramnad in Tamil Nadu and also routes connecting Raipur, Rourkela, Jharsuguda and Jagadalpur with Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad. In Telangana, Turbo Aviation has been given permission to start services from Hyderabad to Nagarjuna Sagar, which will be a sea plane route.
